                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Salvation is God's free gift to us but we must accept it.&nbsp; We can never 
                    make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works.&nbsp; Only by trusting 
                    in Jesus Christ as God's offering of forgiveness, can anyone be saved from 
                    sin's penalty.&nbsp; When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in 
                    faith, we are saved.&nbsp; Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus 
                    Christ into his life by faith.
