              God's Purpose: Peace and Life</font></b><p>
          God loves you and wants you to experience peace and life--abundant and eternal.</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Romans 5:1</p><p>
          "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever 
          believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." John 3:16</p><p>
          "I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more 
          abundantly." John 10:10
          </p><p>
            Why don't most people have this peace and abundant life that God planned for us 
            to have?<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <b><font size="3">Step Two<br>
                The Problem: Our Separation</font></b>
          </p><p>
          God created us in His own image to have an abundant life. He did not make us as 
          robots to automatically love and obey Him. God gave us a will and a freedom of 
          choice.</p><p>
          We chose to disobey God and go our own willful way. We still make this choice 
          today. This results in separation from God.</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23</p><p>
          "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ 
          Jesus our Lord." Romans 6:23</p><p>
            <b>Our Attempts to Reach God</b>
          </p><p>
          People have tried in many ways to bridge this gap between themselves and God...</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death." 
          Proverbs 14:12</p><p>
          "But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden 
          his face from you, so that he will not hear." Isaiah 59:2
          </p><p>
            No bridge reaches God...except one.<br>

            <b><font size="3">Step Three<br>
                God's Bridge: The Cross</font></b>
          </p><p>
          Jesus Christ died on the Cross and rose from the grave. He paid the penalty for 
          our sin and bridged the gap between God and people.</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus 
          Christ." 1 Timothy 2:5</p><p>
          "For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to 
          bring you to God." 1 Peter 3:18</p><p>
          "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, 
          Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
          </p><p>
            God has provided the only way. Each person must make a choice.<br>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <b><font size="3">Step Four<br>
                Our Response: Receive Christ</font></b>
          </p><p>
          We must trust Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and receive Him by personal 
          invitation.</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens 
          the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me." Revelation 3:20</p><p>
          "Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the 
          right to become children of God." John 1:12</p><p>
          "That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your 
          heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." Romans 10:9</p><p>
            <b>Where are you?</b>
          </p><p>
          Will you receive Jesus Christ right now?</p><p>
          Here is how you can receive Christ:</p><p>
            1.Admit your need (I am a sinner).
            <br>
            2.Be willing to turn from your sins (repent).
            <br>
            3.Believe that Jesus Christ died for you on the Cross and rose from the grave.
            <br>
          4.Through prayer, invite Jesus Christ to come in and control your life through 
          the Holy Spirit. (Receive Him as Lord and Savior.)</p><p>
            <b>How to Pray:</b>
          </p><p>
          Dear Lord Jesus,</p><p>
          I know that I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. I believe that You died 
          for my sins. I want to turn from my sins. I now invite You to come into my 
          heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as Lord and Savior.</p><p>
          In Jesus' name. Amen.</p><p>
            <b>God's Assurance: His Word</b>
          </p><p>
          If you prayed this prayer,</p><p>
            <b>The Bible says...</b>
          </p><p>
          "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." Romans 10:13</p><p>
          Did you sincerely ask Jesus Christ to come into your life? Where is He right 
          now? What has He given you?</p><p>
          "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from 
          yourselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast." 
          Ephesians 2:8,9</p><p>
          Receiving Christ, we are born into God's family through the supernatural work 
          of the Holy Spirit who indwells every believer. This is called regeneration, or 
          the "new birth."</p><p>
          This is just the beginning of a wonderful new life in Christ. To deepen this 
          relationship you should:</p><p>
            1. Read your Bible everyday to know Christ better.
            <br>
            2. Talk to God in prayer every day.
            <br>
            3. Tell others about Christ.
            <br>
            4. Worship, fellowship, and serve with other Christians in a church where 
            Christ is preached.
            <br>
          5. As Christ's representative in a needy world, demonstrate your new life by 
          your love and concern for others.
