    <h7><p>On January 2, 1988, a group of Chinese Christians who originally came from Taiwan met Elder Wu Yung of Lin Sun South Road Church to discuss their vision of forming a church in the vicinity of La Habra to meet the spiritual needs of local Chinese Christians as well as non-Christians.  A steering committee was elected to advance this vision.  Members of the committee were brothers Wu-Tze Hua, Henry Huang, John Chi and sisters Sharon Wu, Mu-Shan Lee, and Gloria Chien.</p>

    <p>On April 1 of the same year, the committee decided to formally name the congregation as Whitter Chinese Christian Church.  An inaugural worship service was held on may 22, 1988 at 2:00pm.  Elder David Cheng and Brother Daniel Ho, who became the church minister in October 1988, came from Lin Sun South Road Church to provide ministerial support.  Missionary Chi-Hsiung Wang also joined the church as a minister in March 1990.  After servingGod in the church for six months, he and his wife were sentout as missionaries to the Wah Tribe near Northern Thailand.</p>

    <p>In November of 1992, Brother Henry Huang and Daniel Ho were selected and ordained as Elders.  In December of 1994, sister Gloria Chien and Brother Joseph Kuang accepted as ministers.  A month later, Brother Howard Hsieh was also accepted as minister for the English congregation.</p>

    <p>In January of 1994, the church purchased the nursery land at the present church site and began the planning for the first phase of the church building construction.. In December of 1995, the church moved to Rowland Heights and sharedthe facilities of Otterbein Baptist Church for services and fellowships.  In March of 1996, the church was officially renamed as the Rowland Heights Community Christian Church.  With God's Blessing, the support of prayers, and donations from brothers and sisters residing in Southeast Asia, North America and sister churches in Taipei, the church was able to start the first phase of construction in May, 1996, and was completed in seven months.</p>

    <p>The new church facility was formally dedicated to the Lord on January 26, 1997  At present, the congregation attending Sunday worship is about four hundred people.  This is  in addition to one hundred children in Sunday school.  With the blessing of God, our church is growing in quantity as well as in quality.  The urgent need of more facility space has promoted the planning for the second phase of the church building construction.  The conditional use permit of the church site has been filed with the Los Angeles County to incorporate the construction of the second phase.  Hopefully, the permit will be granted by late spring of  next year.</p>

    <p>In April of 1998, Brother Ted Ewing was accepted as the minister for the English congregation.  In August, 1998, Brother Richard Cho was selected and ordained as Elder to assist Elder Huang to shepher the congregation.  For the past years, the church has not only involved itself in Gospel preaching to its surrounding community,  but has also actively participated in overseas missionary ministry.</p></h7>
